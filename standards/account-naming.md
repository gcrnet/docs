# gcrNet Account Naming Standards

## Purpose

The purpose of this Standard is to identify account naming conventions for use within the gcrNet. These conventions are important to ensure consistency across the gcrNet as it is used by multiple institutions across distributed geographic locations.

## Scope

The gcrNet technical technical team is charged to carry out this standard. The requirements of the standard apply to all gcrNet managed accounts that are part of the gcrnet.org domain.

## Requirements

### User Accounts

All gcrNet user objects will be in the format of: (first name).(last name)##@gcrnet.org where first and last name are strings and ## is an optional numerical increment. For example:

* user John Doe would have the username of john.doe@gcrnet.org
* A 2nd user named John Doe, the 2nd username would be john.doe2@gcrnet.org.

### Groups

All gcrNet group objects will be in the format of: g-(name) where name is a descriptive string. Multiple word are separated by the '-' character  For example:

* group 'Technical Team' would have the group name of g-technical-team

### Service Accounts
